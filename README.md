# Techdegree-Project-10


You've been tasked with creating a library management system for a small library. The librarian has been using a simple sqlite database and has been entering data in manually. The librarian wants a more intuitive way to handle the library's books, patrons and loans.

You'll be given static HTML designs, a set of requirements and the existing SQLite database. You'll be required to implement a dynamic website using Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.


To initialize the project , download the files and run npm install followed by npm start. The program runs on localhost:3000
